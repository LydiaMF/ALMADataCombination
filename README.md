# Data Combination Tool for ALMA

Development of a Python tool in CASA (software for radio interferometric data) for the combination of interferometric and single dish telescope data from ALMA

- ca. +10 members (USA, Japan, Europe), SCRUM/agile/hackathon-like meetings; GitHub for version control

- several combination algorithms or concepts available; use and performance unclear

- I designed the first user-friendly Python tool to run the various combination methods (module, mainly by me) and their analysis (module, mainly by colleagues) with user-defined parameters
